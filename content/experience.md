## Banga Sahitya Kutir

I actively participated in building up the **whole backend and tech infrastructure** at [Banga Sahitya Kutir](https://bangasahityakutir.com/). It is a **book publishing business**, by my friend. I should never take up all the credits to myself. Multiple people like **[Rupak Biswas (Frontend Developer)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupak-biswas-bb51761b9/)**, **[Malay Khamroi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malay-khamroi-104696254/), writers** and of-course the business owner **[Samitendra Bhattacharjee](https://www.facebook.com/samitendra.bhattacharjee)** took part in this venture.

We started with **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)**, then eventually moved on to **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)** stack for various reasons (read [this](https://dev.to/abir777/my-experience-with-a-headless-cms-strapi-3j9o/)).

Some key features I worked on:
- **Custom controllers, security and permission checks** in a headless cms - **strapi**.
- **Image optimization, searching, sorting and debounce** in **Next.js**.
- Used **Django and HTMX (https://htmx.org/)** with reactivity in multiple pages.
- **SEO, backups, cron jobs, Image optimization, PWA, OAUTH, E-Mail, captcha, payment and shipping integration, order tracking, cancellation and invoice generation**.
- Deployed on **AWS** EC2, S3 and Cloudfront for CDN.
