# Currency Exchange

A simple react app, mainly to learn react, [mui](https://mui.com/) and css.

Thanks to [this](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api#readme) repo for the API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# **[Live demo](https://dev-abir.github.io/currency-exchange/)**

## Steps to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

To install the libraries used here.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
