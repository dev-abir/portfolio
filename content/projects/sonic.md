# sonic

A super fast code judging system, which compiles and runs programs locally.

NOTE: This app has been developed with the assumption that it will be used in a controlled lab environment, so security is not so tight.

## How to run

-   Follow the instructions given in `sonic_server` and `sonic_client` directories. You should start the server first, then the client.
-   The client is to be deployed in every machines of the lab, the server needs to be placed in any one pc, and make sure of their connectivity.
